🚧 Microprocessor_Project

A simple Arduino project that controls a servo motor gate using an IR obstacle sensor.
When an object is detected, the gate opens automatically; otherwise, it stays closed.

🧰 Hardware Requirements

Arduino (Uno / Nano / Mega)

Servo Motor (e.g. SG90)

IR Obstacle Sensor

Jumper Wires

Power Supply

🔌 Wiring
Component	Arduino Pin
Servo Signal	D2
Servo VCC	5V
Servo GND	GND
IR Sensor OUT	D9
IR Sensor VCC	5V
IR Sensor GND	GND
⚙️ How It Works

IR Sensor = HIGH → Gate Opens → Servo rotates to 180°

IR Sensor = LOW → Gate Closes → Servo rotates to 0°

Status messages are printed to the Serial Monitor

🧠 Logic Overview

Read IR sensor digital output

Decide gate state (open / close)

Rotate servo to the corresponding angle
